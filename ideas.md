# Ideas #

- classifying distribution in data
	- list of classes of distrubition
	- find list of constants
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment-generating_function
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulant
		- constants that need to be derived for each class (i.e mean, stdv; ignore arbitrary params)
			-mean
			-variance
			-skewness
			-kurtosis

- determine range of electropotential to help define hamiltonian (microcanoical ensamble) for along the scalp


# Notes #
- flat gausssian for mean distrubtion of voltages
- shallow quad modal stdv ""
- "" tri modal for skew ""
- approx dirac delta for kurt ~1, <3  (some guassian)
